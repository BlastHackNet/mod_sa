# and setting this to around whatever your average maximum FPS normally is, for a much smoother
# gaming experience...  especially with SA:MP.  You can try even a tad lower FPS, and notice that
# world objects load a lot faster.  Our default is 60 FPS because this matches a lot of LCD monitors
# which can't even display more than 60 FPS.  Hopefully this clears this up for newbs thinking we just
# added an FPS limiter.  We did not.  It's been in GTA this whole time.  All we're doing is providing an
